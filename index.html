				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am a futuristic person who always aims high for the betterment of myself and my family, and I believe education is the ladder to attaining my dreams. 
I am here to reinvent myself and pursue a career in IT as I am always keen on Technology. Moreover, IT is a booming industry globally and requires highly demanding jobs. I am taking this course after considering all the aspects which will be fruitful for me to finish the degree and join the industry as an IT professional.
I have worked as a sales assistant in a retail company for almost seven years and have seen the changes made there the advancement of IT. Hence, it is the right time to get involved in this field and become productive. This course will help me gain relevant skills that will be industry oriented.
RMIT is better at positioning its students for the industry but at the cost of future flexibility.

					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<div id="test">
					<p>The result has shown that I am more of an introvert. Especially, quietness is a bit of an enigma. As a result, there would be a lack of communication and a struggle to express ideas and thoughts. Consequently, the team cannot produce a great outcome. 
The best approach is to build on specific traits rather than changing nature, which may help to gain more extroverted qualities. For instance, extroversion may depict skills like collaboration, leadership, and communication. 
The primary learning style is kinesthetic learning, which means learning practically. Through this sort of learning, my ability and creativity can be significant. As a kinesthetic learner, I could learn more when working as a team. However, the result has shown that I am also flexible in the other learning styles.
The result of creativity has shown that I can be more innovative. Sharing ideas and thoughts would help the team produce considerable consequences.

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>This project involved creating software for posturing alerts. The user would get the alert to correct the poor posture while working on the desktop. 
One of the most significant challenges people are facing in today's world as the use of technological advancements is poor posturing. In most cases, it may lead to chronic back and neck pain, injury, and other health problems. Regardless of doing the exercise and fixing the cause of pain, it is necessary to be aware and follow the correct posture throughout the tasks. However, accomplishing this idea will require higher skills and technology.
</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>People may not realize or are unsure if they are in bad posture while sitting in front of the computer unless it causes pain. 
Building this webcam-based posture correcting tech is to help workers stop hunching over their desks. Moreover, it can be a prevention tool for practising poor posture. 
Statista research department has projected that the number of people over 15 years of age living with chronic back and neck pain in Australia will expand to 5.23 million by 2050 compared to 3.2 million in 2018.

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Posture mirroring software to assist workers to stop hunching over their desks and sending alerts when detected.
It uses the webcam to check on your posture. So, there need to be comfortable with the software watching through the lens as you work.
It uses two data points that employers signed up to use the tool and how many hours of sitting in front of the screen.

The AI also processes data locally on the device, which means it does not require an internet connection. This software component runs offline, without the internet, without recording or storing visuals. As data, like photos or videos, cannot be passed to the cloud without an internet connection, that is the only way employers could spy on employees. It is technically impossible for us and employers to record or store any visuals and eventually spy on people. Because the software only receives the complete company information on how many employees sign up for the app and how many use it weekly, not the personal information. These two data points can show whether employees are engaged with the application.
The posture correction feature, which accesses individuals’ cameras, does not run on the cloud, meaning no one can access data, including visuals. There is a feature enabled for quick posture checks or a couple of times a day than keeping it on all the time.
It is also possible to combine the posture monitoring feature with other apps that require the webcam to be on, such as when making a videoconferencing call.  

The software integrates with the user’s general computer workflow running in the background and imaging the user’s pose through a stick-man icon shown in the menu bar, which allows users to keep alert without being interrupted by awake messages. Blue and upright are good; bent and red are bad. Nevertheless, it never sends pop-up message alerts. Users can choose a few options on how they want to be alerted.
The user needs to demonstrate their upright posture on setting up. Then the app uses that to build a user-specific mathematical model that records key posture points such as joints, nose, ears, etc. The AI can detect posture differences in real-time when the camera monitoring is enabled and decide whether the person is slouching.
These posture points are fed to a mathematical model that compares the current position to the original baseline position set as your upright position. In addition, the software involves geometrical formulas to vectors assembled by your current posture position and your original baseline upright posture position to determine if you’re slouching.

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>OpenCV and MediaPipe are the primary packages required to implement the project. Furthermore, A functional application would need a webcam pointing to the side view.
MediaPipe is an open source, cross-platform framework for making machine learning pipelines to process time-series data like video, audio, etc. The ML solution Media Pipe pose is used for detecting the posture.
OpenCV is a computer vision library that contains numerous computer vision algorithms. It delivers accessible and practical computer vision infrastructure, which helps to build advanced computer vision applications quickly. It is a part of Artificial intelligence, allowing the computer to understand any form of the data feed to them. (Such as images, videos, visual input, etc.) Moreover, make appropriate decisions based on the knowledge gained from the provided data.
It supports various programming languages, Such as C++, Java, Python, etc.

					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>OpenCV is a great tool for developers for the implementation of image processing and computer vision applications. It is open-source and has large community support for learning, tutorials, and contributions.
Knowledge of OpenCV Python and MediaPipe.  
Learn how to use media pipe to create a body posture detection system.
Comfortable with a programming language such as Python and C++.
There is significant community support for learning and free online tutorials to understand the basics. On the one hand, It is feasible to learn basic knowledge. On the other hand, It is not easy to apply those skills for the first time in real-time projects.
Computer vision skills combined with diverse skills such as Machine learning.

					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>People who work in front of the desktop are affected the most by neck and back pain. There would be a possible effect of solving the issues. 
Doing short, small daily sessions increases posture awareness and behaviour change. Furthermore, Users will start to notice slouching and naturally move back into an upright position. 
It is not necessary to leave it to be on all day. Instead, using 30 minutes feature a couple of times a day for seven days would see excellent results in increased posture awareness and decreased back and joint pain.
